Midikrew is a music sampler online with saving / exporting abilities. You can produce electronic tracks and save them to a .json file

Future roadmap includes the possibility of adding your own samples and hold a permanent reference to them using cloud storage, and you will be able to save your projects on a json database so you can share them with other members of the community!
